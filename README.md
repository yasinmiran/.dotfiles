# Yasin's .dotfiles

Hi welcome to my `dotfiles` project. I'm going to use this repository throughout my software engineering career and dev
lifetime! Below is a comprehensive explanation on how do I structure these dotfiles.

## How to `install`?

First navigate to home `cd` and clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yasinmiran/.dotfiles.git` and
navigate to dotfiles director using `cd ~/.dotfiles`. Now execute the below commands.

```bash
$ ./install --except shell
```

After executing above command, dotfiles are linked successfully. To pickup the changes you must quit the current
terminal process and all the functions will be preloaded to your zsh environment. Now you can re-run the installation
command like below.

```bash
$ ./install # or ./install --only shell
```
